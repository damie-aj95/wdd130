            <h2>History</h2>
            <p>Founded in 1995, Splash Wild Water Rafting began with a simple dream: to share the exhilarating beauty of whitewater rivers with adventurers from around the world. What started as a small family operation with just two rafts has grown into one of the region's most trusted rafting companies. Over the past three decades, we've guided thousands of guests down pristine rapids, trained dozens of expert guides, and maintained an impeccable safety record. Our commitment to environmental stewardship and community involvement has made us not just a business, but a vital part of the river conservation movement.</p>
